## Terraform Configurations Repository

Welcome to my Terraform configurations repository! This space is dedicated to hosting various Terraform scripts and configurations I create to automate and manage cloud infrastructure. As I continue learning and experimenting with Terraform, I will be adding new configurations here.

### Current Configuration
1. **EC2 Instance Creation**: 
   - This configuration demonstrates how to provision an EC2 instance using Terraform. You can use this as a basic template to customize and launch instances on AWS.

### Future Additions
I will be adding more configurations for various cloud services and use cases as I progress with my Terraform knowledge.

Feel free to explore the configurations and adapt them to your own cloud infrastructure needs!
