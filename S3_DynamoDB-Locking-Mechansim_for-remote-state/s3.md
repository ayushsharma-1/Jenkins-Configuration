# Terraform S3 Backend Configuration

This document outlines how to configure Terraform to use an S3 bucket and DynamoDB table for remote state management. The backend configuration will use an S3 bucket to store Terraform state files and a DynamoDB table to manage state locking.

## Requirements

- **Terraform Version**: 1.9.5 or higher.
- **AWS CLI**: Configured with valid AWS credentials and region.

## Backend Configuration

You can configure the S3 backend using the following settings in your `main.tf` file.

### main.tf Configuration

```terraform
terraform {
  backend "s3" {
    encrypt = true
  }
}
```

This configuration ensures that the state files are encrypted using AWS S3's default encryption method (AES-256).

### Partial Configuration Example

To manage different environments, you can use a configuration file like `backend-dev.conf`. This allows you to define S3 and DynamoDB table configurations that can be dynamically switched based on your environment (e.g., `dev`, `prod`).

**Example `backend-dev.conf`:**

```plaintext
bucket  = "<account_id>-terraform-states"
key     = "development/service-name.tfstate"
encrypt = true
region  = "ap-southeast-2"
dynamodb_table = "terraform-lock"
```

In this file:

- `bucket`: Name of the S3 bucket (make sure it's globally unique).
- `key`: The key (path) where the state file will be stored.
- `encrypt`: Enables encryption for the state file.
- `region`: The AWS region to use for the S3 bucket and DynamoDB table.
- `dynamodb_table`: The name of the DynamoDB table used for state locking.

### Using Environment-Specific Variables

You can further customize your environment by creating a `.tfvars` file for each environment, such as `dev.tfvars`, to manage environment-specific variables.

**Example Commands:**

```bash
env=dev
terraform get -update=true
terraform init -backend-config=config/backend-${env}.conf
terraform plan -var-file=config/${env}.tfvars
terraform apply -var-file=config/${env}.tfvars
```

These commands perform the following:

- `terraform get -update=true`: Downloads the necessary modules.
- `terraform init -backend-config=config/backend-${env}.conf`: Initializes Terraform with environment-specific backend configuration.
- `terraform plan -var-file=config/${env}.tfvars`: Runs the Terraform plan using environment-specific variables.
- `terraform apply -var-file=config/${env}.tfvars`: Applies the Terraform configuration to the environment.

## Notes

- **State Locking**: A DynamoDB table (`terraform-lock`) is used to ensure that only one Terraform operation can modify the state at a time, preventing race conditions.
- **State Encryption**: S3 encryption is enabled by default for security purposes.
